# 🌟 Find the Golden Star

A simple Python console game where the player guesses a coordinate on a hidden 3×3 map to find the *Golden Star*.  
It combines randomness, user input validation, and basic logic control — perfect for beginners learning about loops, classes, and conditionals in Python.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The game randomly hides a golden star (`$$`) somewhere on a 3×3 map.
2. You enter a coordinate (for example: `11`, `23`, or `32`).
3. If your guess matches the star’s position — you win! 🎉  
   If not, the map updates and you can choose to play again or quit.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (class & methods)
- Random number generation using `random`
- Error handling with `try` / `except`
- Input validation
- Loops and conditionals
- Basic use of external module imports (`mapcode`)
